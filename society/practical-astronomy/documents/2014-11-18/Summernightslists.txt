Summer Nights Observing lists

CAS Practical Astronomy 18/11/2014



Night One: Orion and Milky Way - Binos 

- Don’t rush!
- Take a night to enjoy wide field bino views
- Become familiar with the sky
- Scan the richness of the Milky Way
- Binoculars show thousands of stars & clusters
- Identify stars and objects listed
- Dark skies are best

- Look at the richness of milky way, Haydes, Pleiades, M35
- Orion nebular, NGC 1981 Open cluster & Belt cluster.
- Identify double stars of Orion: Iota, Sigma, Mintaka, Rigel, Lambda
- Loose star cluster around Lambda Orionis
- Gamma Lepus: bino double 3.5/6.1-100”
- Secondary much dimmer toward centre of Lepus - need steady binos!
- Can you see globular cluster M79 in Lepus - dim, small and fuzzy!


Double star notation: 3.5/6.1-100"

Stars are magnitude 3.5 and 6.1, separated by 100 arc seconds
10 arc seconds is easilly visible in small scopes at 50x magnification
closer stars may require higher power, but try lower power first to
make them easier to find.


Night Two: Around Orion with a Telescope

- Revisit Pleiades & M35 with scope - rich areas of sky
- Orion Nebula M42, bright centre, outlying nebula visible on dark night
- M43 - part of same nebula divided off by dust lane
- Trapezium - tight quadruple star in heart of M42 - box shape
- Iota triple star - close double 2.7/7-11", dim secondary,
- Very dim third star further way in arc, mag 9.7-49”
- Same field, bright wide pair HIP 26197&99 4.8/5.6-32” 
- Sigma quadruple - easy triple in line 3.7/6.6/6.3-13"/41",
- Dim fourth star close on opposite side 8.8-11”
- Mintaka 2.2/6.8-53" wide but dim secondary
- Rigel 0.3/6.8-9.3" close, difficult, much dimmer secondary
- Lambda 3.5/5.4-4.1” - very close, dimmer secondary,
  amongst large loose cluster of stars.
- Very wide bino double Gamma Lepus - 3.5/6.1-100”, unrelated stars.
- Wide double HIP 25397 in centre of Lepus, 5.8/7.5-26”
- M79 globular cluster, dim and fuzzy in small scope
- brighter concentrated centre.



Night Three: Monoceros to Puppis with binos

- Rich part of the Milky Way
- Many stars and faint clusters from c-Puppis to M50
- Become familiar with Canis Major - find M41 and M50
- Identify Tau and 145 CMa double.
- Nice cluster around Tau CMa in telescope.
- k-Puppis double and M93 are nearby.
- c-Puppis is the bright red star in open cluster NGC2451
- NGC2477 is near b-Puppis. 100’s of dim stars. Hazy patch.
- M47 is big and bright. M46 is dim and hazy.
- Note stars 2 and 4 Puppis. 2-Pup is an easy telescope double


Night three - part 2: Finding your way around Monoceros

- Halfway between Orion’s belt and bright Sirius are Gamma
  and Beta Monoceros.
- Beta is a nice telescope triple.
- Loose cluster NGC 2232, near Beta Mon, resolves in binos
- Follow the line of dim stars from Betelgeuse to Epsilon, 18,
  and Delta Monoceros
- Further on is the small triangle of Zeta, 27 and 28 Monoceros
- Above is Alpha, and to the right is open cluster M48.
- The Rosette nebula contains a small cluster.
- On a dark night the nebula itself might be visible in binos
  with averted vision.
- 4 stars arc down from Epsilon Mon to Xi Gemini.
- The Christmas tree cluster is around 15 Monoceros, big.



Night Four: Monoceros to Puppis with a Telescope

- M41 Open cluster - big, bright, many stars
- Tau Canis Major cluster - Just a bright star at first glance, but
- Averted vision makes many stars appear!
- Colourful wide double 145 CMa  5/5.8-26" Orange/Blue
- Evenly matched close but easy "cat eyes" pair k-Puppis 4.4/4.6-10"
- M93 rich small open cluster, many tiny stars and haze
- c-Puppis - Bright red star in big bright cluster NGC2451
- b-Puppis - near the dimmer cluster NGC2477 with hundreds of
  tiny stars and haze
- M47 big and bright, scattered stars.
- M46 hundreds of dimmer stars - nice on a dark night
- 2 Puppis double 6/6.8-17"
- Find M47 first, then M46 and 2 Puppis will drift into view over
  10 minutes
- M50 & M48, good open clusters, many stars
- Beta Monoceros triple - close double 4.6/5-7.2", secondary is
  very close double 5.0/5.3-2.9" need highest power and a very
  steady night. A fourth dimmer star is 250" away.
- More stars of 2232 visible in telescope, need wide field
- Rosette cluster shows more detail in telescope
- Christmas tree cluster needs wide field but shows stars like
  lights on a cone shaped Christmas tree.
