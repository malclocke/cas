      <h1>Open Nights</h1>
<p>
The Canterbury Astronomical Society (CAS) hosts public Open Nights during the
winter months (April to September). Open Nights run from 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.
on designated Friday nights, weather permitting.
</p>
<p>
Members of the public are invited to join us and have a look through
professional quality telescopes, each of which is operated by a member of the
society. These members are happy to answer your questions about the objects you
are viewing. 
</p>
<p>
Individuals and small groups of fewer than 10 people are welcome to visit on
any Public Night. <strong>Booking is not required for groups of fewer than 10
people.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Organised groups of <strong>10 to 35 people are required to book</strong> their
visit to the Observatory. When booking, please download and complete <a
  href="/open-nights/Bookings_form.docx">this form</a>, and email it to
<a href="mailto:bookings@cas.org.nz">bookings@cas.org.nz</a>.
</p>
<p>
We regret that bookings for groups larger than
35 people cannot be accepted due to observatory site restrictions. Groups
larger than this may wish to consider booking multiple sessions of up to 35
people each.
</p>
<p>
If the sky conditions are too poor for viewing, a notice will be placed on the
main page of this website and on our 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/CanterburyAstronomicalSociety">FaceBook page</a>
by 6:45 p.m. Please check one of those sites before heading out to the
observatory.
</p>
<p>
For general open night queries, please email
<a href="mailto:bookings@cas.org.nz">bookings@cas.org.nz</a>.

<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>
<strong>$10.00 per adult</strong> or <strong>$7.00 per child</strong> (ages 5 to 15) (cash only).
</p>
<p>
If your group is from a large organisation, you might prefer to consider your
organisation becoming a Corporate member of the society for between $210 and
$240. Family groups might prefer to consider becoming a Family member of the
society for between $105 and $120. Please refer to the Membership Form page and
CAS Constitution for full details. Corporate and Family society members are
welcome to book an open night for an organised guided tour for their corporate
group or family. Holding a Corporate or Family membership entitles your group
or family to attend any open night at no extra charge, some members of your
organisation or family may even like to become involved in the society.


<h2>Phases of the moon and choosing when to visit.</h2>

<p>
If you are particularly interested in observing the fainter objects in the
night sky, we recommend you try to organise your visit to coincide as close as
possible with a new moon. The best lunar phases for deep sky observing are
between last quarter and first quarter (spanning the new moon phase). If you
are interested in viewing the moon (lunar observing) then we recommend you try
to organise your visit to be at least two days or more before or after the new
moon, and for a night when the moon will be above the horizon.
</p>

<h2>On the night of your visit</h2>

<p>
The home page of the CAS website will be updated no later than 6:30pm, advising whether the observatory is open or closed. The observatory may be closed during wet weather, so check the home page before visiting to avoid disappointment. On cloudy evenings, a cloudy-night presentation and discussion will be held.
Please dip your headlights before arriving. Onsite parking is reserved for society members, please angle-park on the roadside, outside the observatory. Please wait outside the gate until 7:30pm as it will be dark and astronomers will be moving about setting up equipment. Walk down the driveway towards the lodge, following the red lights. 

Suggestions to improve your viewing experience

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dress Warm</strong>
  We recommend that you dress warm, as the telescopes (and you) are exposed to
  the winter night air.</li>
  
  <li><strong>No torches</strong>
  Becoming dark-adapted is essential for seeing the faint fuzzies that make up
  the deep sky.  It takes 10-15 minutes for the pupil in your eye to expand to
  its maximum aperture.  Over another 15 to 20 minutes, a chemical reaction in
  the eye kicks in that further boosts its sensitivity.  A single shot of white
  light can ruin your night vision for up to 30 minutes.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Skymap</strong>
  Free maps of the night sky available at SkyMaps.com each month - great for
  the kids.  Make sure you get the southern hemisphere map!
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Kidsfest</h2>

<p>
Kidsfest is an annual event organised by TV2. For 2014, the CAS observatory
will be open every night of Kidsfest from 7:30pm to 9:00pm, weather permitting.
Check the home page of the CAS website at 6:30pm each night of Kidsfest for
confirmation. A donation of $5.00 per head for ages 5 and above applies (cash
only). Visit http://www.kidsfest.co.nz for more information about Kidsfest.
