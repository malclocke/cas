Sat 5th December
----------------
The annual CAS Summer BBQ will take place this year on Saturday 5th December at
the [R.F. Joyce Observatory](/observatory/location.html).  This is a great
opportunity for old members to catch up, and for new members to meet others
in the society.

This year's event will be preceded by a working bee from 1pm.  There are many
small jobs for all abilities to be done and all members are encouraged to pitch
in in whatever way they can.

The working bee will start at 1pm, the BBQ will start at 6pm.  You are not
required to take part in the working bee to attend the BBQ.
