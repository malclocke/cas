==============================================
The CAS AGM will take place during the monthly meeting at 8:00pm Tue 17th March
2015.

In addition to the AGM, Gary Steel will give a short talk on future plans
for the CAS observatory.

The meeting will be preceeded at 7:00pm by our practical astronomy session.

catalogue, the CAS catalogue, and observing madness!*

The CAS main meeting is held at 8:00pm on the 3rd Tuesday of the month (except
December and January), in room F3 of the University of Canterbury School of
