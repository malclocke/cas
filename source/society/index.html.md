Canterbury Astronomical Society
===============================

The Canterbury Astronomical Society (CAS) is one of the largest astronomical
society in the South Island with a membership of approximately 90 members.

We meet monthly at the University of Canterbury.

The Society's main meeting is on the third Tuesday of the month, starting at
8:00pm. Click here to see our meeting dates and location. All things
astronomical are discussed at these meetings, from informal chats among
members, to guest speaker presentations, along with annual Soapbox evenings and
light hearted quiz nights.

Practical Astronomy for All Ages is a friendly, informal meeting catering to
those who are just starting out in astronomy, as well as those looking for
practical assistance and advice. This meeting is held on the third Tuesday of
the month, beginning in March 2009, from 7:00pm to 7:45pm and precedes the
society's main monthly meeting. The contact for information on this is David
Brian, phone .

On the Saturday immediately following the monthly meeting of the society, there
is a gathering at the Society's observatory sited 18 km to the west at West
Melton just outside of Christchurch City. This gathering gives new astronomers
the chance to get help with their telescopes or in locating objects with the
more experienced observers on hand to help out.

The Saturday meeting night nearest the shortest day marks the Society's famous
Mid-Winter Starparty, a celebration marking the time of Matariki - the Maori
new year. After a barbeque we light the bonfire, get out the marshmallows and
open the CAS secret recipe mulled wine to keep out the winter chill for a fun
filled evening under the stars.

The R.F. Joyce Observatory, at West Melton is privately owned by the Society
and contains a number of telescopes including a 14in cassegrain reflecting
telescope which is used for photography, visual and photometric observing.

Recent acquisitions have been a 12" Meade LX200, a 24" Dobsonian for those
interested in deep sky observing, and a 16" Meade RCX400, which together give
us superb light gathering capacity.

A number of other portable/Dobsonian telescopes are also used for the numerous
groups we have visiting us.

The observatory site includes, in addition to the domes, a meeting room with
kitchen facilities and an adjacent toilet block.
