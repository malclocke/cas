Monthly Meetings
================

The CAS main meeting is held at 8:00pm on the 3rd Tuesday of the month (except
December and January), in room F3 of the University of Canterbury School of
Forestry. The main meeting at 8:00pm is preceded by the Practical Astronomy for
All Ages meeting from 7:00pm to 7:45pm, in room F3 of the University of
Canterbury School of Forestry. Any member of the public who is considering
joining the Society is welcome to attend either or both meetings.

        <p>
          As a summer intern at the Australian Astronomical Observatory I worked
          on low surface brightness imaging with the Huntsman Array. The Huntsman
          Array is an innovative project using commercial Canon sports lenses for
          astronomical imaging. The low amount of scattered light in the Canon
          lenses gives opportunities for imaging very faint galactic structures
          that cannot be seen with large reflecting telescopes. I will talk about
          my contributions to this project and the spin-off cubesat space
          telescope, Huntsman in Space.
