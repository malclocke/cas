Monthly Meetings
================

The CAS main meeting is held at 8:00pm on the 3rd Tuesday of the month (except
December and January), in room 275 of the Von Haast building of the University
of Canterbury School of Biological Sciences. The main meeting at 8:00pm is
preceded by the Practical Astronomy for All Ages meeting from 7:00pm to 7:45pm,
in the same room. Any member of the public who is considering joining the
Society is welcome to attend either or both meetings.

        <p>
          As a summer intern at the Australian Astronomical Observatory I worked
          on low surface brightness imaging with the Huntsman Array. The Huntsman
          Array is an innovative project using commercial Canon sports lenses for
          astronomical imaging. The low amount of scattered light in the Canon
          lenses gives opportunities for imaging very faint galactic structures
          that cannot be seen with large reflecting telescopes. I will talk about
          my contributions to this project and the spin-off cubesat space
          telescope, Huntsman in Space.

        <strong>What do you get when you mix a telescope and a 747?</strong>
        - Karina Leppik
        <p>
        NASA&apos;s SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy) is
        based in Christchurch for six weeks this winter to observe Southern
        Hemisphere objects.  As the only currently operating airborne
        observatory, and the only mission or facility currently in operation
        capable of providing mid- and far-infrared data, SOFIA&apos;s unique
        capabilities allow for unique observations.  Karina Leppik, a Mission
        Director for SOFIA, will talk about the telescope, airplane, challenges
        of airborne astronomy, and some of SOFIA's science in this general
        audience talk.

        <strong>Meteoroids, Meteors, and the CAMS Project</strong> - Ian Crumpton
        <p>Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance.</p>
        <p>
          The CAMS project, now operating in Canterbury, seeks to observe and
          describe the meteoroid streams that Earth regularly passes through.

          Ian Crumpton has been involved in astronomy for over 40 years, having
          been a society member in Gisborne, Blenheim, Dunedin, and, since
          1991, Canterbury. He has spoken to many U3A and other groups on
          subjects as wide ranging as astronomy, the roots of science, the
          evolution of religion, and of western music. He was president of CAS
          for six years prior to Euan.
