        <strong>Spiders In Space - Toby Hendy</strong>
        As a summer intern at the Australian Astronomical Observatory I worked
        on low surface brightness imaging with the Huntsman Array. The Huntsman
        Array is an innovative project using commercial Canon sports lenses for
        astronomical imaging. The low amount of scattered light in the Canon
        lenses gives opportunities for imaging very faint galactic structures
        that cannot be seen with large reflecting telescopes. I will talk about
        my contributions to this project and the spin-off cubesat space
        telescope, Huntsman in Space.
