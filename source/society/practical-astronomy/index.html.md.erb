Practical Astronomy
===================
Practical Astronomy is a friendly, informal meeting open to all interested
people. We meet on the 3rd Tuesday of the month (except December & January), in
room F3 of the University of Canterbury School of Forestry.

The Practical Astronomy meeting starts at 7:00pm and is followed at 8:00pm by
the society's monthly meeting. Attendees are welcome to stay for both meetings. 

Notes and slides from previous sessions are archived below.  To see a list of
the topics for the upcoming Practical Astronomy sessions see the [monthly
meetings page](/society/meetings.html).
