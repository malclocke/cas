Earth Hour
==========

The observatory will be open to members of the public for Earth Hour this year.

We will be open between 7:30pm and 9:00pm. Entry will be by gold coin donation.

Opening will be dependant on the weather, so please check back here or on our
website at http://www.cas.org.nz/ before heading out to the observatory. We
will post a status update before 6:45pm on Saturday as to whether we are open
or not.
