The observatory will be open to members of the public for Earth Hour this year.

We will be open between 7:30pm and 9:00pm. Entry will be by gold coin donation.

Opening will be dependant on the weather, so please check back here before
heading out to the observatory. We will post a status update before 6:45pm on
Saturday as to whether we are open or not.
