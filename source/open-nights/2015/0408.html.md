The observatory will be open for a party from Leeston School.  We **will not
be open to the general public**.

We will be open between 7:30pm and 9:00pm.

Opening will be dependant on the weather, so please check back here before
heading out to the observatory. We will post a status update before 6:45pm
as to whether we are open or not.
