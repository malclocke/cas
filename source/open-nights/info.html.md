Open Night Information
======================

The Canterbury Astronomical Society (CAS) hosts open nights, during the winter
months (April to September) when daylight savings is not in effect.

Members of the public are invited to join us and have a look through
professional quality telescopes, each attended by a member of the society who
will operate the telescope and explain what you are seeing through it.  $10.00
per adult or $7.00 per child (ages 5 to 15) (cash only).

You are encouraged to ask as many questions as you like, and we will do our
best to answer them all.

Organised groups of 10 to 35 people are required to book their visit to the
Observatory. Booking will allow the society to prepare for a larger group and
arrange for more astronomers to be present. We regret that bookings for group
sizes larger than 35 cannot be accepted due to observatory site restrictions.
Groups larger than 35 may wish to consider booking multiple sessions of up to
35 people.To book your group's visit, click the link for one of the Available
Group Booking nights in the table below.

Individuals and small groups of fewer than 10 people are welcome to visit on
any public night shown in the table below as Open. Booking is not required for
groups of fewer than 10 people.

Open nights run from 7:30pm to 9:00pm, weather permitting.
