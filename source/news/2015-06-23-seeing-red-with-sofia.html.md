title: Seeing red with SOFIA
---

This winter sees the second visit to Christchurch of the Stratospheric
Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).  SOFIA is an airborne observatory
operated by NASA and the German Aerospace Centre DLR.

A lucky few CAS members were given a tour of the aircraft by Nick Veronico,
SOFIA's public affairs officer.

The aircraft

      A display monitor in the hangar let us know it was a balmy 37 degrees
      outside as we prepared to be led across the tarmac.  Unfortunately this
      was Fahrenheit for the convenience of the SOFIA crew.  We walked through
      a snow shower, given some extra kick by the exhaust from a nearby taxiing
      jet, to the aircraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOFIA is housed in a 1977 Boeing 747SP.  This is a short bodied version
      of the standard 'jumbo jet'.  NASA purchased the aircraft in 1997 for
      modification into an airborne observatory.  The rear pressure bulkhead of
      the aircraft, normally under the tail, was removed and replaced with a
      new bulkhead just rear of half way down the fuselage.  Everything aft of
      this bulkhead, including the telescope itself, is unpressurised during
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large sliding door opens in the rear section of the aircraft to uncover
      the telescope once it reaches operating altitude.  A considerable amount
      of wind tunnel design went into this door and its surroundings to ensure
      it does not effect the aerodynamics of the aircraft.  Apart from when the
      door is initially opened, the pilots are often unaware of whether the
      telescope door is open or shut other than the status of an indicator in
      the cockpit.

The telescope and instruments

      The SOFIA telescope is a bent cassegrain design.  The 2.7m parabolic
      primary mirror (2.5m clear aperture) has a very fast focal ratio of
      1.28.  In the cassegrain design, the hyperbolic secondary mirror greatly
      increases the effective focal length of the system, the final focal ratio
      of the telescope is 19.6.  Unlike many cassegrain telescopes where the
      light passes through a hole in the primary mirror to the focus, the SOFIA
      telescope has a tertiary mirror which deflects the light at right angles
      through the centre of the altitude bearing to the instruments.  This is a
      common arrangement on large telescopes known as a Nasmyth focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telescope mount has an altitude range from 15 to 70 degrees from the
      horizontal, but only a couple of degrees of movement in azimuth.
      Targeting objects in azimuth is achieved by turning the aircraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SOFIA instruments sit on the pressurised side of the rear bulkhead.
      During the 2013 SOFIA campaign in NZ only one instrument was fitted, but
      for the 2015 campaign 4 instruments have been brought.  Changing the
      instruments on the telescope away from the SOFIA home base is a
      considerable challenge for the SOFIA technicians that has required a
      large amount of specialist equipment be brought to Christchurch for
      this deployment.

Challenges of infrared astronomy
--------------------------------
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>
      The main challenge of infrared astronomy is the attenuating effect of
      water vapour in the Earth's atmosphere.  Water vapour absorbs almost all
      infrared radiation from space, making ground based infrared observations
      difficult.  Flying in the stratosphere, SOFIA can climb above 95% of this
      water vapour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another difficulty with infrared observations is the intrinsic heat of
      the atmosphere and telescope instruments.  Thermal imaging cameras
      operating in the infrared region just beyond the sensitivity of the human
      eye can easily pick up the heat of a human body.  The SOFIA telescope
      operates at a temperature of around 240 kelvin, well below freezing.  But
      even at these very low temperatures the telescope positively glows in the
      mid infrared (MIR) region.
    </p>
    <p>
      To combat this, SOFIA uses a 'chopping' secondary mirror.  The secondary
      mirror oscilates quickly between the target and an adjacent patch of dark
      sky.  The dark sky signal can then be subtracted from the target signal
      to remove the systematic contamination of the telescope and 'dark' sky.

      CAS would like to extend a huge thank you to the SOFIA team for allowing
      us the opportunity to tour the observatory, and especially to Nick
      Veronico for his time and hospitality.  We wish the SOFIA team the
      greatest success on this and future deployments in Christchurch, and
      beyond.
